You can upgrade your Fusion license through the UI, either by uploading one you already have or by purchasing a new one. 

1. Click the **Upgrade License** option on the dashboard.
1. If you do not have a new license, click on the option to purchase a license now. Follow the provided instructions to obtain your license.

   Once your license has been sent, ensure it is available on your local machine.
1. Upload your new license via the Drag 'n' drop or click to select files.
1. Review the license preview and ensure it is correct before selecting to **Upload**.

   The License information will then update with your new limits and expiry date.

If the license fails to upload, see the manual process in our [community article](https://community.wandisco.com/s/article/Updating-Fusion-license-files-on-Docker-appliance).
